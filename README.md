## AIMS

This course aims to acquaint students with the basics of the Python programming language and its application to data collection, manipulation, visualization, and analysis. During the course, the students will learn how to write code, gather data from web sources using modern scraping techniques, organize data into a usable format, and analyze data collections to answer questions about the world.

We will begin with an introduction to general-purpose programming: data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. We will investigate how to write succinct and efficient code. We will then see how to gather data from the web by using the python library and represent it inside python as a DataFrame. We will investigate how programming can help us clean and present the data in an informative and elegant manner. Finally, we will focus on using data to answer real economic questions, covering popular exploratory and statistical data analysis techniques.
